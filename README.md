# Human-pose-detection
Human Pose Detection is a computer vision task that includes detecting, associating,
and tracking semantic key points. Examples of semantic keypoints are “right shoulders,”
“left knees”.
Human pose estimation from video plays a critical role in various applications such as
quantifying physical exercises, sign language recognition, and full-body gesture control.
For example, it can form the basis for yoga, dance, and fitness applications. It can also
enable the overlay of digital content and information on top of the physical world in
augmented reality.
Essentially it is a way to capture a set of coordinates for each joint (arm, head, torso,
etc.,) which is known as a key point that can describe a pose of a person.
The connection formed between the points has to be significant, which means not all
points can form a pair. From the outset, the aim of Human Pose Detection is to form a
skeleton-like representation of a human body and then process it further for
task-specific applications.
